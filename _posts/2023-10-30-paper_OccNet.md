## 1. introduction

Human driver can easily describe the complex traffic scene by visual system. Such an ability of precise perception is essential for driver’s planning. To achieve this, a geometry-aware representation that quantizes the physical 3D scene into structured grid map with semantic labels per cell, termed as 3D Occupancy, would be desirable.
